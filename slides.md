## Community of Python users
* Web backend developers
* Data science
* Machine learning
  
---
## Useful packages in Python
* sympy
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* pandas

# Installation
* Refer to another guide
* Recommendation:
  * Anaconda
  * Google colab
  
---
## Install packages (with anaconda)
* ```conda search xxxxxx```
* ```conda install xxxxxx```
