# Min, Max and Sum
Write a program which reads a sequence of nn integers $$a_i(i=1,2,...n)$$, and prints the minimum value, maximum value and sum of the sequence.

## Input
In the first line, an integer nn is given. In the next line, nn integers aiai are given in a line.

## Output
Print the minimum value, maximum value and sum in a line. Put a single space between the values.

## Constraints
$$0<n≤10000$$
$$−1000000≤ai≤1000000$$

## Sample Input
